Application_UDP is a Java code that simulates a client-server UDP connection. Use the Run_simulation class to run the system in local.
If you want to perform the connection over different devices run client class on one device and run the server class on the other one. 
The server class needs of all the classes inside the Application_UDP to work, except for the UDPClient and Run_simulation class. 
Each of the devices will have to set in each side of the system before executing the ip address of the other side and from which port they are listening.
